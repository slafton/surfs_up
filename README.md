# üèÑ Surf's Up! üèÑ

## Overview
### I made it to Hawaii for some rest and relaxation and fell in love with surfing. now all I can think about is hitting those waves and have come up with a plan to live the dream. I want to open a Surf n' Shake shop. I have reached out to W. Avy, an esteemed surfer, to assist in turning my dream into a reality. W. Avy tried a Surf Shop several years back but it was rained out. Before investing, he wants to look at some weather analysis to predict the successfullness of the Surf n' Shake shop.

## Summary
### By evaluating our temperatures I feel that we could make a go of our Surf n' Shop. I know that W. Avy has concerns regarding rainful so I went ahead and looked at the precipitation for June and December as well.

### Our precipitation numbers are looking good too. This is great news. Our shop could be a success. This is a life changing venture however so I have done some more reading on surfing around Hawaii and came across this article.

### This article talks about November through April being a more dangerous time to surf due to storms. I feel that more analysis on storms should be done before proceeding as we don't want our Surf n' Shop to be washed away. Thinking about what those storms could be like got me thinking about wind. After reading the following article I also think we should like at some wind data analysis as well.
